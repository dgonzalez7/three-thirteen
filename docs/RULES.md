# Three Thirteen — House Rules

## Overview
Three Thirteen is a multiplayer card game for 2–8 players. It is part of the Rummy family. The goal is to form sets and runs with the cards in your hand, accumulating the fewest possible penalty points over 11 rounds of gameplay.

> **Note:** These are house rules and represent a variant of the published rules. In a future version of the game, players will be able to select from multiple rulesets in the Game Lobby.

---

## Players
2 to 8 players.

---

## Deck
The number of standard 52-card decks used depends on the number of players:

| Players | Decks |
|---------|-------|
| 2–3     | 1     |
| 4–5     | 2     |
| 6–8     | 3     |

Aces are **low** in runs (A-2-3 is valid; Q-K-A is not), but count **high** (15 points) as penalty cards.

---

## Setup
The first dealer is chosen randomly. After each round, the deal passes to the left.

Cards are dealt according to the round number:

| Round | Cards Dealt | Wild Card |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 1     | 3           | 3s        |
| 2     | 4           | 4s        |
| 3     | 5           | 5s        |
| 4     | 6           | 6s        |
| 5     | 7           | 7s        |
| 6     | 8           | 8s        |
| 7     | 9           | 9s        |
| 8     | 10          | 10s       |
| 9     | 11          | Jacks     |
| 10    | 12          | Queens    |
| 11    | 13          | Kings     |

All remaining cards are placed face-down to form the **draw pile**. The top card of the draw pile is turned face-up to start the **discard pile**.

---

## Wild Cards
In each round, one rank of card is wild (see table above). Wild cards may be substituted for any card in a set or run. Wild cards count as their face value if left in hand as penalty cards at the end of a round.

---

## Gameplay
The player to the left of the dealer goes first. Play continues clockwise.

On each turn, a player must:
1. **Draw** — take either the top face-down card from the draw pile, or the top face-up card from the discard pile.
2. **Discard** — place one card face-up on the discard pile (unless going out).

---

## Sets and Runs
Players aim to arrange their cards into valid combinations:

- **Set** — three or more cards of the same rank (e.g. 7♠ 7♥ 7♦).
- **Run** — three or more cards of the same suit in sequence (e.g. A♥ 2♥ 3♥).

Additional rules:
- Sets and runs may contain more than three cards.
- No card may belong to more than one combination.
- Any combination of sets and runs is valid (e.g. two sets and one run).
- Players may **not** add cards to combinations played by other players.

---

## Going Out
A player may go out on their turn if, after drawing, they can arrange **all** of their cards into sets and runs with exactly **one card left over** to discard.

To go out, a player:
1. Announces they are going out.
2. Lays their sets and runs face-up on the table.
3. Discards their final card.

After a player goes out, each remaining player gets **one final turn** (clockwise), then the round ends and scoring takes place.

Only one player may go out per round — the first player to do so. If a subsequent player, during their final turn, can arrange all their cards into valid sets and runs with one card left over, they score 0 points for the round but the game does not treat this as a new 'going out' event. The original going-out player remains recorded and the final turn sequence continues normally.

---

## Scoring
After the final turn of each round, all players arrange their hands into as many valid sets and runs as possible and lay them face-up on the table. Any cards not part of a valid combination are scored as **penalty points**:

| Card        | Penalty Points |
|-------------|---------------|
| Ace         | 15            |
| King        | 10            |
| Queen       | 10            |
| Jack        | 10            |
| 2 through 10 | Face value   |
| Wild card   | Face value    |

The player who went out scores **0 points** for that round.

---

## New Round
After rounds 1–10, all cards are reshuffled and a new round begins with the deal passing to the left.

---

## Winning
Scores are tallied after each round. After the 11th round, the player with the **lowest cumulative score** wins.

---
